\title{Acquire Maximal Subtree Information}
\description{
    Extract maximal subtree information from a RF-SRC object.  Used for
    variable selection and identifying interactions between variables.
}
\usage{\method{max.subtree}{rfsrc}(object,
  max.order = 2, sub.order = FALSE, conservative = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{An object of class \code{(rfsrc, grow)} or \code{(rfsrc,
	    forest).}} 
  \item{max.order}{Non-negative integer specifying the target number
    of order depths.  Default is to return the first and second order
    depths.  Used to identify predictive variables.  Setting
    \option{max.order=0} returns the first order depth for each
    variable by tree.  A side effect is that \option{conservative} is
    automatically set to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{sub.order}{Set this value to \code{TRUE} to return the
    minimal depth of each variable relative to another variable.
    Used to identify interrelationship between variables.  See
    details below.}
  \item{conservative}{If \code{TRUE}, the threshold value for selecting
    variables is calculated using a conservative marginal
    approximation to the minimal depth distribution (the method used
    in Ishwaran et al. 2010).  Otherwise, the minimal depth
    distribution is the tree-averaged distribution.  The latter method
    tends to give larger threshold values and discovers more
    variables, especially in high-dimensions.}
  \item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\details{
  The maximal subtree for a variable \emph{x} is the largest subtree
  whose root node splits on \emph{x}.  Thus, all parent nodes of
  \emph{x}'s maximal subtree have nodes that split on variables other
  than \emph{x}.  The largest maximal subtree possible is the root
  node.  In general, however, there can be more than one maximal
  subtree for a variable. A maximal subtree may also not exist if
  there are no splits on the variable.  See Ishwaran et al. (2010,
  2011) for details.
  
  The minimal depth of a maximal subtree (the first order depth)
  measures predictiveness of a variable \emph{x}.  It equals the
  shortest distance (the depth) from the root node to the parent node
  of the maximal subtree (zero is the smallest value possible).  The
  smaller the minimal depth, the more impact \emph{x} has on
  prediction. The mean of the minimal depth distribution is used as
  the threshold value for deciding whether a variable's minimal depth
  value is small enough for the variable to be classified as strong.
  
  The second order depth is the distance from the root node to the
  second closest maximal subtree of \emph{x}.  To specify the target
  order depth, use the \code{max.order} option (e.g., setting
  \option{max.order=2} returns the first and second order depths).
  Setting \option{max.order=0} returns the first order depth for each
  variable for each tree.
  
  Set \option{sub.order=TRUE} to obtain the minimal depth of a
  variable relative to another variable.  This returns a
  \code{p}x\code{p} matrix, where \code{p} is the number of variables,
  and entries (i,j) are the normalized relative minimal depth of a
  variable j within the maximal subtree for variable i, where
  normalization adjusts for the size of i's maximal subtree.  Entry
  (i,i) is the normalized minimal depth of i relative to the root
  node.  The matrix should be read by looking across rows (not down
  columns) and identifies interrelationship between variables.  Small
  (i,j) entries indicate interactions.  See
  \command{find.interaction} for related details.
  
  For competing risk data, maximal subtree analyses are unconditional
  (i.e., they are non-event specific).
